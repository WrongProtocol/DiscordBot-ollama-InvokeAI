I had a really hard time finding examples on how to use the InvokeAI API, 
so I felt compelled to share this particularly for the InvokeAI.py file 
which outlines how to generate an image , poll for completion (because the restful api doesnt have the same benefits as a websocket) 
and get the final image, later sending it to the discord server where the request originated. 
Just for fun.
